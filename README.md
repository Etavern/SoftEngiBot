# SoftEngiBot

### A Software engineering project

USAGE:
1. Open terminal, run nerfherder.py:
	python nerfherder.py
2. Open another terminal (ctrl + alt + t), run nerf.py:
	python nerf.py


USAGE NOTES
* If Nerfherder and nerf are in the same folder, then the files they send/get will overwrite themselves
(basically it deletes the content)

	(Note: the verification of the function can still be tested; view the output of the nerf.py window


* Scan doesn't cause nerfherder to give any output, check nerf.py window


* Error checking not yet implemented; if bad input causes hanging, exit BOTH terminal windows using the OS GUI to ensure processes are killed, and rerun
