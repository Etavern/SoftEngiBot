# SoftEngiBot

### A Software engineering project

None standard libraries (need sudo pip)
* PIL

The functions are self explanatory

### Quirks
* If Nerfherder and nerf are in the same folder, then the files they send/get will overwrite themselves
(basically it deletes the content)
* Scan doesn't cause nerfherder to give any output, check nerf
* It input to a functions is bad, doesn't error check and explodes. Rerun
